We have employed your knowledge and skills in hopes to produce a fully functional mobile application designed as something wearable. Some examples may include watches, clothing, eye-glasses, hats, or anything capable of being worn by the human body. For the application, we would like it to be able to text 911 or any of your favorite contacts and have a traceable GPS system. We would also like to be able to track health concerns such as being able to detect a heart attack, count a person's pulse and check glucose levels all through testing the userâ€™s skin. Furthermore, we would like the system to run in a mobile environment where the system's availability is no less than 99% at any given time. Finally, we would like the system to be modifiable to which we can extend the system to other services in the future without issue.
